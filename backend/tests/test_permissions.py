"""
Permission tests for Unix-like permission model.

Permission model:
- Organization has an explicit owner (like root)
- Only owner can update/delete organization, add/remove org members
- Any org member can create teams
- Any team member can add other org members to the team (Unix group model)
- Any team member can remove themselves from a team
- Only org owner can delete teams
- Board can be shared with a team or made public to org
- Board owner can share boards
- Team members (or org members if public) can access/modify boards
