# Auth & Organization Schema

## Overview

Multi-tenant organization model with team-based board sharing.

## Models

### User

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | Integer | Primary key |
| username | String(100) | Unique username |
| password_hash | String(255) | bcrypt hash |
| email | String(255), null | User email |
| admin | Boolean | Platform super admin (default: false) |

### Organization

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | Integer | Primary key |
| name | String(200) | Organization display name |
| slug | String(200) | URL-friendly identifier, unique |
| created_at | DateTime | Creation timestamp |

### OrganizationMember

Many-to-many relationship between User and Organization.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | Integer | Primary key |
| user | ForeignKey(User) | Member user |
| organization | ForeignKey(Organization) | Organization |
| role | String | owner \| admin \| member |
| joined_at | DateTime | When joined |

### Team

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | Integer | Primary key |
| name | String(200) | Team name |
| organization | ForeignKey(Organization) | Parent organization |

Special team: Each org has an "Administrators" team created by default.

### TeamMember

Many-to-many relationship between User and Team.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | Integer | Primary key |
| user | ForeignKey(User) | Team member |
| team | ForeignKey(Team) | Team |
| role | String | admin \| member |
| joined_at | DateTime | When joined |

### Board

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | Integer | Primary key |
| owner | ForeignKey(User) | User who created the board |
| name | String(200) | Board name |
| shared_team | ForeignKey(Team), null | Team with access |
| created_at | DateTime | Creation timestamp |

**Board Access Rules:**
- `shared_team = null`: Private board, only owner can access
- `shared_team = set`: Shared with that team, owner + team members can access

**Permissions:**
- Owner: Full control (edit, share, delete, change shared_team)
- Team members: Full edit access (cards, columns), cannot delete or change sharing

## Access Control Logic

### Board Access Check

```python
def can_access_board(user, board):
    # Owner always has access
    if board.owner == user:
        return True

    # Check team access
    if board.shared_team:
        return TeamMember.exists(
            (TeamMember.user == user) &
            (TeamMember.team == board.shared_team)
        )

    return False
```

### Org Role Mapping

| Org Role | Access Level |
|----------|--------------|
| owner | Full org control, can manage members, teams, delete org |
| admin | Can manage members, teams, billing settings |
| member | Can view org, create teams, create boards |

### Platform Admin

Users with `admin = true` on User model can:
- Access any board (bypasses ownership/team checks)
- Manage any organization
- View system-wide analytics
- No special UI, just elevated API permissions

```
User ──┬── OrganizationMember ── Organization ── Team ── TeamMember
       │         (M2M)                  │
       │                              Board
       │                                │
       └────────────────────────────────┘
         (owner FK on Board)
```

## Migration Notes

When upgrading from single-user boards to multi-tenant:

1. Create Organization table
2. Create OrganizationMember table
3. Create Team table
4. Create TeamMember table
5. Add fields to User: email (nullable), admin (default false)
6. Add field to Board: shared_team FK (nullable)
7. Existing boards remain owned by original user, shared_team = null (private)

No automatic org creation for existing users. Users can optionally create organizations and migrate boards if desired.
